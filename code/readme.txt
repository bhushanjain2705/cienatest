How to run Program:

I have combined both functionality in one program, you can specify your choice whether to run for first problem or second by providing input as 1 or 2 respectively.

import the code in editor (eclipse) and run it as a java application you will see output console with instructions as follow:

Problem 1-> Example 1-----------------------------------------------------

Enter no. of elements you want in array:6
Enter all the elements:
-1 1 2 3 10 7
Enter (1 or 2): 
 1.for Smallest Missing Positive Integer 
 2.for Max Element (which is greater than its neighbor):
1
smallest missing element->4

Problem 1 -> Example 2-----------------------------------------------------

Enter no. of elements you want in array:5
Enter all the elements:
-1 -2 5 6 9
Enter (1 or 2): 
 1.for Smallest Missing Positive Integer 
 2.for Max Element (which is greater than its neighbor):
1
smallest missing element->1

Problem 2 -> Example 1-----------------------------------------------------

Enter no. of elements you want in array:7
Enter all the elements:
1 2 3 4 2 3 1
Enter (1 or 2): 
 1.for Smallest Missing Positive Integer 
 2.for Max Element (which is greater than its neighbor):
2
index of max element->3

Problem 2 -> Example 2-----------------------------------------------------

Enter no. of elements you want in array:6
Enter all the elements:
1 3 2 6 5 7
Enter (1 or 2): 
 1.for Smallest Missing Positive Integer 
 2.for Max Element (which is greater than its neighbor):
2
index of max element->1
